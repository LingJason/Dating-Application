# Dating Application - (Personality Pair)
This project was created using React for the front-end,Node.js and express for the backend and MongoDB for the database. I'm use to using PostgresSQL for my database so I wanted to try something new, hence why I choice MongoDB. This application allows users to create a profile and connect to new matches.
